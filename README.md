# PAM4Driver
This work presents the design of a driver circuit for generating a four-level Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM-4) format in Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) optical modulators. Higher-level modulation formats are inevitable for enhancing spectral efficiency and achieving high data rates in silicon-on-insulator (SOI) optical modulators.
